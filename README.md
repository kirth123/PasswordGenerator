# PasswordGenerator

This application allows users to create randomly generated passwords. However, the user can customize their passwords. In other words, the passwords are randomly generated to certain criteria. For example, if I wanted to generate a password with only capital letters and numbers, I could inform the application to only generate a password with those types of characters.
